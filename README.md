# Estimating Transfer Entropy via Copula Entropy
This is the code for the preprint paper "Estimating Transfer Entropy via Copula Entropy" which available at [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04375). Transfer Entropy is estimated via estimating three Copula Entropy terms. Estimating copula entropy is easily done with the R package '[copent](https://cran.r-project.org/package=copent)'. The method is demonstrated with the UCI Beijing PM2.5 data which is publicly available at [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+PM2.5+Data).
